Hey! I’m Brayden — welcome to my little corner of the internet.
I’m really glad you’re here. This profile is basically my cozy digital space, where I keep everything I’ve been working on, the things I’m learning, and the projects I’m currently pouring my energy into.

If you scroll through, you’ll find:

• All my contact methods — whether you want to talk, collab, or just chill
• The tools, languages, and libraries I use — everything that helps me bring ideas to life
• What I’m learning at the moment — because I’m always trying to level up
• My current projects — the things I’m building, improving, or experimenting with
• A few extra things — just because it feels right

Take your time, look around, and make yourself at home.
And seriously, if something catches your attention or you just want to talk, I’m always around.
